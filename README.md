## 🧩 Problem Solving Approach
Follow this structured approach to solve problems effectively:
1. **Understand the Problem** 🤔  
   Carefully read and analyze the problem statement. Clarify any doubts before proceeding.
2. **Plan the Solution** 🧠  
   Break the problem into smaller tasks, choose the right data structures, and identify the algorithm to solve it.
3. **Write the Code** 💻  
   Implement the solution in your chosen language, making sure to adhere to best coding practices.
4. **Test the Solution** ✅  
   Test your solution with edge cases and a variety of test inputs to ensure correctness.
5. **Optimize (if needed)** ⚡  
   Look for opportunities to improve the time and space efficiency of your solution.
